# Inventory-Management-System

## Introduction
Managing an inventory, especially for those who seek client satisfaction, is a main thing to know how to deal with, and knowing the kind of inventory you are dealing with and how it works you need some information to make the process easier and to make the cost as less as possible, here where APIs do the work and have the main role of making this managing process such a success !!!

This is an inventory management system for searching for specific items if exist in this branch of inventory or not, checking whether their orders are ready to be shipped or not, also checking if the inventory is capable of receiving new orders and packages with different sizes or not, so the packages couldn't be transported to that specific branch of inventory so they don't have to transport the order again back to the provider.
